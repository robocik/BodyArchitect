<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We are committed to protecting the privacy
and security of the users of our Programs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This Privacy Policy will advise you about
our guidelines concerning the use of your personal information, including,
without limitation, the reasonable efforts we make to protect your personal
information in accord with these guidelines, and about what choices you have
concerning our use of such information. Please read this policy carefully. We
may need to change this policy from time to time in order to address new issues
and reflect changes on our Program. We will post those changes here so that you
will always know our policies regarding what information we gather, how we
might use that information, and whether we will disclose that information to
anyone. Please refer back to this policy regularly. If you have any questions
or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please send an e-mail to </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Scope Of Privacy Policy </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This Privacy Policy applies to your use of
the program BodyArchitect . This policy does not apply to your use of programs
to which the program BodyArchitect links. This policy covers only information
collected on the Program and does not cover any information collected offline
by us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Personal Identification Information </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We may request personal identification
information from you (such as your name, street address, telephone number,
e-mail address, and/or any other identifier that permits the physical or online
contacting of you) in connection with your use of, or participation in,
membership registration for BodyArchitect, our contests, sweepstakes,
promotions, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content
submissions, chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups, requests for
suggestions, visitors' requests for free products or services, or additional
information (including via e-mail to us), and in connection with other
activities, services, features or resources we make available on any of our Program.
In all of these cases, we will collect personal identification information from
you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. Except as otherwise
provided in this policy, we reasonably endeavor to ensure that we never
intentionally disclose any personal identification information about you as an
individual user to any third party without having received your permission
(through opt-in or similar procedures) except as provided for herein or
otherwise as permitted or required under law. Further, we may contact you based
on the information you provide online whether in connection with your
registration or in such places as the above described forum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If you do provide us with personal
information for any of these activities, we may use it to conduct the activity.
In addition, in the event that your personally identifiable information is
requested as part of our surveys, polls or promotions, such personally
identifiable information may be added to your registration information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We may also contact you to confirm your
registration and communicate about your account status, as well as regarding
changes to the Programs' Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If you give us your permission, we may also
use personal identification information for internal or external marketing and
promotional purposes. On occasion, for example, we may send you e-mails to introduce
a product or a service that we think might be of interest to the users of our Program.
For us to obtain your permission to send you this information, we will give you
an opportunity to &quot;opt-in&quot; at the time our request for your personal
information is made. If you do &quot;opt-in,&quot; you may choose to
&quot;opt-out&quot; at any time, even after you have provided personal
information, by following the procedures set forth below at the end of this
Privacy Policy. Please note, however, that under certain circumstances, if you
initially do not choose to &quot;opt-in,&quot; or if you later
&quot;opt-out,&quot; you may not be eligible for certain benefits for which a
name, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal  identification
information is needed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We have the following exceptions to these
policies: We will release specific information about you or your account to
comply with any valid legal inquiry or process such as a search warrant,
subpoena, statute  or court order. We will also release specific information in
special cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of the security of the Program,
or a physical or property threat to you or others. We may also transfer user
information, including personally identifiable information, in connection with
a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of related assets  or corporate
division, or other fundamental corporate  change. We may provide access to your
personally identifiable information to our contractors who are performing
services for us in connection with our programs or the services that you have
requested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In addition, on occasion, we may collect
personal identification information from you in connection with optional
contests, special offers or promotions. We will share such information with
necessary third parties for the purpose of carrying out the contest, special
offer or promotion. Your participation in the contest, special offer or
promotion constitutes your consent to such disclosure and use  of such  information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Further, the information you enter when
making a purchase or an online donation will be shared  with  payment
processors, financial gateways, and your credit card company to authorize
credit card payments. Such information may also be shared with necessary third parties
 solely  for the purpose or carrying out the transactions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Please note that if you give out personal
information online - for example, on one of our public forum  such as a message
board or chat room, folder or chat IM feature - that information can be
collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to protect our users'
privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you post in these
forums and have no control over how such third parties may use your
information.  You disclose such information at your own risk.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>You are responsible for maintaining the
confidentiality of your information and password.  You shall be responsible for
all uses of your registration, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to
immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your registration or password.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Non-Personal Identification Information </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Non-personal identification information
might include the type of computer, technical information about your means of
connection to our Program such as the operating system and other similar
information. Our Program may also automatically gather information about the
areas you visit and search terms you utilize on our Program and about the links
you may select from within our Program to other areas of the World Wide Web or
elsewhere online.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We use such information for our business
purposes, and, in particular, to administer the Program, better manage
advertising on the Program, and, in the aggregate, to understand how our users
as a group use the services, features and other resources provided on our Program.
This way we know which areas of our Programs are favorites of our users, which
areas need improvement, and what technologies are being used so that we may
continually improve our Programs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We may share this aggregate statistical
information with our partners, suppliers and other third parties, but we will
not share any individual names, personal navigational or other personal
information. For example, we may use a third-party advertising company to serve
ads when you visit our Program. We may share demographic and preference
information with this company to allow them to display appropriate
advertisements for you. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We use a proprietary advertising server to
display ads on our Program. In addition, advertisers may elect to use
third-party advertising companies to serve ads onto our Program. Some of our
advertisers may display ads on our Program that may use cookie technology or
Web beacons to (i) identify non-personal information about our users (such as
connection speed, browser and country of origin) and (ii) track user behavior
within our Program. Advertisers generally use such information to customize the
display of ads within our Program. We will not permit such advertisers to
collect any personal information from our users within our Program, however,
you may choose to voluntarily provide the advertisers with your personal
information. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that
they may contain.</span></p>
