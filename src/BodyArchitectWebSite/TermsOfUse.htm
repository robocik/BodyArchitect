for the submissions you Distribute on or through the Program under your

submitting and posting same. We have no duty to monitor any Forum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Also, you should be skeptical about
information provided by others, and you acknowledge that the use of any
Submission posted in any Forum is at your own risk. For example, we are not
responsible for, and we do not endorse, the opinions, advice or recommendations
posted or sent by users in any Forum and we specifically disclaim any and all
liability in connection therewith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We owe you no obligation, and therefore may
